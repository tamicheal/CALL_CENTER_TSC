# CALL_CENTER_TSC/ CHANGING PRJOECT INTO TWO PROJECT 
I'll be doing analysis on a call center data just to test my skills on T-SQL and Tableau, I'll be sticking to using SQL and Tableau for this process and track my steps and challenges. --step one find data and attach file for a call center--
FIND DATA FROM A GITHUB PAGE https://github.com/fedemeister/call_center

DECIDE TO GO WITH A DIFFERENT DATA THE WELL-KNOWN SOURCE FILES ADVENTUREWORKS2016 

I IMPORT THE DATABASE USING THE WIZARD--"C:\AdventureWorks2016.bak" FILE INFO IS ON GITHUB

LINK AND INFORMATION --gh repo clone microsoft/sql-server-samples--

git clone -n https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples
cd sql-server-samples
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo samples/features/*| out-file -append -encoding ascii .git/info/sparse-checkout
echo samples/demos/*| out-file -append -encoding ascii .git/info/sparse-checkout
git checkout.

# ASK STEP ONE
The product I am looking to build is a dashboard in tableau for a manager to track KPI for his team.

The name of the company is Adventureworks. Step one is to ask questions and think out design.

For designing I perform pen and paper I'll add the sample drawing in the final.

QUESTIONS WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, STARTING WITH WHO IS THIS FOR

/*NOTE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT DATA I KNOW AND ITS THIS DATA IS ALREADY IN A DATABASE IS MANAGED BY AN DBA WHO HAS CREATED THIS DATA FOR US, I WILL BE ANALYZING DATA TO FIND WHAT I NEED*/

WHO- MANAGER, SUP, AND CALL REPS

WHY- MANAGER NEED DASHBOARD TO QUICKLY CHECK TOP THREE METRICS;

TSA= TOP SUPPORT AGENTS
FCR= FIRST CALL RESOLUTIONAL
CVT= CALL VOLUME TRENDS

/*TOOK A PAUSE TO OPEN WORD/ NEED TO DO SPELL CHECKS AS I GO ALONG AND, ALSO DOWNLOADED CODING APP NOTEPAD++--*/

WHAT- THIS TEAM HANDLES TECHINCAL CALLS FOR NATION AND TROUBLESHOOT OVER THE PHONE WITH DIFFERENT DEPO.

WHEN- DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY,

WHERE- LOOKING IN TO HEIARCHY OF LOCATION AND POSTIONS 

WENT TO STUDY ON CALL METRICS TSA,FCR,CVT

--NEXT STEPS WILL BE DECIDING WHAT DATA TO USE AND CREATE ER DIAGRAM THIS IS THE ETL STEP FOR ME ILL CREATE SEVERAL QUERIES AND VIEWS IF NEEDED--

### EXTRACTING DATASET I MAY NEED,
TO KEEP THINGS SIMPLE I WILL ASKING THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS OF THE DATA

FOR CVT I NEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CALLS?

WHAT DATA IS NEEDED I'LL CHECK USING MSSQL TO PROCESS THE INFORMATION AND ADD NOTES AND DATA AS BUILD OUT 

DO WE HAVE TOTAL CALL VOLUME?


---HAD TO STOP NOTICED THAT I MAYBE MISSING PART OF DATA AND WILL NEED TO ADD ANOTHER DATABASE FROM THE SITE.

CURRENTLY WAS EXPLORING THE DATA FOR MORE DETAILS

LOOKING TO BREAK THIS INTO TWO DIFFERENT PROJECTS I NEED TO CREATE REGION BREAK I FOUND WE HAVE THREE REGIONAL SALES MANAGERS

MY GOAL IS TO LOOK FOR CALL CENTER DATA THIS HAS CHANGE TO SALES VOLUME AND DEVELOP A DASHBOARD MAYBE LATER, 

I WILL FOCUS ON LOCATING CONTACT RATE DATA AND BREAKING DOWN ROLE--

RAN SEVERAL MORE QUERIES TO CHECK SOME INFORMATION ABOUT VIEWS I MAY WANT TO CREATE FOR LATER USE

I CREATED MY SECOND ERDIAGRAM WHICH I WILL ATTACH TO THE GITHUB, 

#NOTE I AM CHANGING MY PROJECT GOALS AND SPLITING THEM INTO TWO THIS, MOVE NEXT PROJECT INTO DBREAVOR SQL.---04/03/2023-
